# Operators

## `.` Attribute Access

The attribute access operator is used to access data stored in a value of some type. For compounds and structs the data are the fields, for enums it's a variant. This data is associated to an instance of the type.

## `:` Associated Access

The associated member operator is used to get access to members declared in a `type` or `tag` definition. Those members value belong to types no to their instances.
