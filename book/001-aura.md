# Aura Book

Hey be welcome to the Aura programming language nook, there is still no implementation for this language, just planning and designing. Feel free to submit your ideas, but first let me tell you what is Aura.

## The Aura Lang

Aura is meant to be a functional applications programming language. Differently from systems-level programming language, Aura is meant for user applications. We are not trying to replace C, C++, Rust, Zig, etc. We are aiming to create stuff like Kotlin, Go and alike (also, not a replacement). What does that mean? Well, no manual memory allocation here, safe abstractions and all the niceties from next-gen high-level programming languages.

Aura has a long and brilliant future to come, but lets [start with the basics](./002-basics.md)
