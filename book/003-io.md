# Input, Output and Errors

Lets create a simple program to greet our user

```rs
//! main.aura

func main -> Result(Void, Error) {
    print("Hey, what's your name? "); //>> Hey, what's your name?

    name String := readln()??; //<< Aura Lang
    
    println("Nice to meet you " ++ name); //>> Nice to meet you Aura Lang

    ok
}
```

More new stuff, lets take a look:

- `Result(Void, Error)`: remember from the chapter one, when we said safe abstractions? This type represents something that might fails, we'll talk about them soon
- `readln()??`: this function reads a line from the terminal as a `String` but this operation might fail (say when pressing `ctrl+c`) so `??` will unwrap the `String` if it succeeds or finishes the current function if it fails
- `"Nice to meet you " ++ name` this concatenates (ie puts together) the two strings (mind the space)
- `ok`: this value indicates that the function succeeded 

## The `Result` Type

The `Result(T, E)` type is a really nice one. For you rustaceans it's about identical to Rust's `Result<T, E>`. 

A result is a type that has 2 variants: `ok(T)` and `err(E)`. It means each variant may have a payload value. In the function type `Result(Void, Error)` we expect the function to return either `ok` (with no payload) or `err(...)` with a payload value of type `Error`.

`Error` is an interface, interfaces will be explained later but think of an interface as a Java interface. It can be used as a type that a lot of different types can be casted to. It represents the group of types that can be used to represent a failure. For instance a `String` implements `Error` since it can be used as a simple generic error message.

`readln` is a function that takes no arguments and return `Result(String, IOError)` so we can use `??` to extract the `String` if it's an `ok` or early return from `main` if it's an `err` (`IOError` is `Error`)

There are some operators for the `Result` type, they are:
- `res??` unwraps the result `res` if `ok` otherwise shortcircuits the function with `err`
- `res?!` unwraps the result `res` if `ok` and panics otherwise
- `res ?= expr` unwraps the result `res` if `ok` or uses `expr` otherwise

Talking about `if`, I think it's time to talk about [control flow in Aura](./004-control-flow.md)
